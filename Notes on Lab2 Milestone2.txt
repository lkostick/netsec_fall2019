- Will have a chain of certificates
- Each group will become an intermediate CA for 20194.team_number (in our case, 20194.1)
- Dr. Nielson will be root CA for 20194
- Do some hierarchical stuff to ensure that a certificate is real
- Prefix matching
- Someone with 20194.1 can sign anything with 20194.1.x.y
- Will send a chain of certificates
- Change to list of certificates (LIST(BUFFER) in the packet definition)


Connection between 20194.3.100.200 and 20194.5.3.2
- The subject of the lowest certificate will just be the playground address
- All users have the root certificate, but the lowest cert will not be signed by the root
- Instead, we also send another cert alongside the lowest cert that has been signed by the root
- Just send certs for the address we are claiming as well as the intermediate cert that has been signed by the root
- PETF can decide whether or not to include the root in the LIST
	- Maybe if we have multiple root CAs
- Receiver should step through a verification process


Issues
- Check if the playground address we think we are talking to is the subject of the certificate
