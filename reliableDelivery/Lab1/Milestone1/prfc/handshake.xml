     <t>The PLAYGROUND (Poly-Localized Algorithmic Yields
     Generated Remotely On Unused Network Devices) system is
     designed to give students and researchers a sandbox in which to develop
     network security experiments. This PRFC specifies the protocol for exchange of information necessary to create a handshake over Playground.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
      This document is aimed to create a protocol for doing handshake between the client and the server and also provide eveyone with the packet defenition.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   <section title="Outline of Interface">
       <section title="Handshake Protocol">
           <t>The Playground Handshake protocol MUST function in the following manner.</t>
           <t><list style="numbers">
                   <t>At initialization, the client will set SYN to be True and send it along side with a challenge set to a random string of length 128. </t>
                   <t>Upon receiving the packet, the server sends back a packet with syn and ack set to True and a signature (which is the challenge sent by client signed by server using server's private key) and also it's public key</t>
                   <t>Upon receiving packet sent by server, client verifies the signature using the public key sent to it, if it was verfied then the client sends a packet with ack set to True and seq_num set to previous_seq_num + 1. If it was not verified the client again tries to send an Ack packet to create the handshake</t>
                   <t>Upon receiving the packet from the client if ack was True then the handshake is successful and if syn was True then the client is trying to retry the handshake</t>
           </list></t>

           <t>Some notes about the process:</t>
           <t><list style="numbers">
                   <t>Each client and server are assigned with a private key and a public key</t>
                   <t>The initial seq_num is set to a number between 0 to 127</t>

   <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

   <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                     v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                     other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                     Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
