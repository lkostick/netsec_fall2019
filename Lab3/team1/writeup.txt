1) Below is a list of each person's contribution to our escape room.

Jacob Flynn: Implemented a new object called 'doll' that is visible when the escape room is started. If the doll is picked up, the player immediately dies.

Sepehr Abdous: Added a 'safe' object that either has a money or a bomb in it. If a user opens the safe, they will randomly either explode (bomb) or survive (money)

Logan Kostick: Changed the hammer to make it bad. No longer will a player be perfectly accurate with their hammer, and now they might miss when they use the hammer.

Justin Lee: Added a safe that is locked by a number pad. The the item inside of the safe is a very gorgeous haiku.

Weichen Wang: Changed the unlock to not be perfect. Sometimes you can fail thanks to a rusty tool.

4) Below are our ratings for each team's escape room.

Team 2: Fun, but I couldn’t figure out how to the chest! The extra life didn’t seem to work. The trap was fun though. 7/10

Team 3: I liked the combination aspect, and the surprise monster as well. Also, the flyingkey commands continued going off even after I got it. 7/10

Team 4: Cool graphics, but it took a really long time to actually get into the game. Chest said it contained none when it actually contained the hammer. The multiple rooms was a really cool addition. 9/10

Team 5: I liked the addition of the guard dog, and the dark room was an interesting addition. Conch shell was clever as well! 8/10

Team 6: I like the feeling of urgency, but the Devil’s Snare never got to me. I also already have the harp and hammer in my inventory without ever unlocking the chest. 5/10

Team 9: I liked the addition of the axekiller and shield, but other than that and the potato I can’t think of any new additions. Works well though! 7/10
